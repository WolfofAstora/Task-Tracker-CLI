# Task-Tracker-CLI

A lightweight Command Line Interface (CLI) application to track and manage your tasks efficiently. This project was build to practice file system operations, JSON data handling and command line argument parsing using bash.

The idea of this project is by roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker. 
Requirements were
* Add, Update and Delete Tasks
* Mark a task as in progress or done
* List all tasks
* List all tasks that are done
* List all tasks that are not done
* List all tasks that are in progress

futher

* Use a JSON file to store tasks.
* Use native file system of your programming language to interact with the JSON file.
* Do not use any external libraries of frameworks to build this project.

I build this project in nvim using the bash syntax
